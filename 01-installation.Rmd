# Installing R and RStudio

## How do I install the R build tools? {#rtools}

If you are not able to install packages from source, you are missing the build tools that are used to compile source code into files that the operating system can execute.

* If you are a Windows user

    - Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools>. Download and install the "recommended" version.

## I'm getting an error when I try to start up RStudio.

### I am on a campus computer, and the error is: "Fatal error: unable to initialize the JIT"

This is due to a bug in your campus profile. Please speak to the [IT Helpdesk](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/it/helpdesk/){target="_blank"}.
