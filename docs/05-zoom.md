# Using Zoom

## How do I set up Zoom for my classes?

To have a smooth experience on Zoom, you must do three things.

1. You must have **the most recent Zoom version.** Before joining your first session, please [update Zoom](#update).

2. Use Zoom on your laptop or PC during the lab. Breakout rooms work much better on your laptop/PC than on a phone or tablet.

3. [Use your UofG email address to sign in to Zoom](#zemail). This is VERY important if your lab/class is using breakout rooms.

## How do I update Zoom? {#update}

- Open Zoom on your desktop 
- Click on your profile pic on the top right corner 
- Go on 'Check for Updates' 
- Install the most recent version 
- Restart your computer 

## How do I sign in with my Zoom email address? {#zemail}

Your UofG email address starts with your Student ID, followed by the first letter of your last name, followed by '@' and then 'student.gla.ac.uk' (e.g., <img src="images/fake_email.png"/>).

When you click on your profile pic on the top right corner, it shows you the email address you have signed in with. This must be your `student.gla.ac.uk` email address.

If you're not signed in with the right email address, sign out and sign in again. You can "Sign in using SSO" and at the prompt where it asks you _____.zoom.us enter "uofglasgow". This will take you to the sign-in page where you enter your GUID and password.
